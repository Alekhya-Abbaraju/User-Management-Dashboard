**DELETE /users/:id**: Delete a user

## Deployment on Vercel
Here is the step-by-step guide to deploy your application on Vercel:

1. Create a Vercel account:
2. Link your GitHub repository:
3. On the Vercel dashboard, click on "New Project".
4. Select your GitHub repository for the project.
5. Follow the prompts to import your repository into Vercel.
6. Configure the Project:
7. Choose the project name and settings. Vercel will auto-detect your project setup.
Make sure to set up the correct build settings if prompted (usually, npm run build is the default for React apps).
8. Deploy: After configuring the project, click "Deploy".Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app.
9. Access the live app:Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a unique URL
    - In my project
      ```bash
       https://user-management-dashboard-6q7a.vercel.app.

### Future Improvements
- Implement real backend interaction instead of using the mock API (e.g., use a database and server like Express.js or Node.js).
- Add more advanced validation for the user input form.
- Implement pagination for large lists of users.
